# Machine Learning Pipeline for Startup Success

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the success of startups based on their historical data. Using Crunchbase datasets, the analysis aims to categorize startups into one of the following statuses:
- **Operating**: The company is functioning and generating revenue.
- **IPO**: The company went public through an Initial Public Offering.
- **Acquired**: The company was acquired by a larger company.
- **Closed**: The company shut down or went bankrupt.

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline is implemented to clean, analyze, and predict startup success. The insights from this project are visualized using **Power BI** for better interpretation.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and development.
- **Power BI**: Visualization of trends, KPIs, and success rates.
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **LinkedIn**: Sharing professional insights and project outcomes.

## 📊 Dataset Details
The dataset is sourced from Crunchbase, containing various features like:
- **Industry, Funding, Employees, Status**
- **Geographic Details (Country, State, City)**
- **Key Metrics (Milestones, Investment Rounds, ROI)**

### Key Columns:
- `status`: Startup's current operational status.
- `funding_total_usd`: Total funding received.
- `funding_rounds`: Number of funding rounds.
- `founded_at`: Year of foundation.
